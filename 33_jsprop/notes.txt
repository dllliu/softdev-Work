K33 -- JS Bubble & Squeak
2023-04-27

Bubble: When looking at the DOM, the events will occur from the bottom 
        of the tree to the top 
Analogy -> bubbles float up 

Capture: When looking at the DOM, the events will occur from the top of 
         the tree to the bottom 
Analogy -> when you capture things you usually go from the top, down

DISCO:
 * Bubbling and caputring depend (in part) on the browser 


QCCs
 * Is there an actual difference (any benefits or drawbacks) from using 
   bubbling vs capturing?
